# Tailwind Template

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without leaving your HTML. Instead of writing custom CSS, Tailwind offers low-level utility classes that help you implement designs quickly, directly in your markup. This makes it incredibly flexible, fast to develop, and easy to maintain.

## Installation
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss 
npx tailwindcss init -p    
npx tailwindcss -i .\src\input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
```
Create your CSS file (e.g., styles.css) and import Tailwind's base, components, and utilities:

```bash
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
Set up your build process in your package.json:

```bash
"scripts": {
  "build": "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch"}
```

## Configuration

Tailwind comes with a default configuration that you can extend by editing the tailwind.config.js file. This file allows you to customize the following:

Theme: Customize colors, spacing, typography, and more.
Variants: Enable different state styles (hover, focus, etc.).
Plugins: Add third-party functionality or your own custom utilities.

## Responsive Design
Tailwind CSS is mobile-first, meaning itâ€™s easy to design responsive layouts. You can prefix your classes with responsive breakpoints:

sm: for small screens
md: for medium screens
lg: for large screens
xl: for extra-large screens
